The damerau-levenshtein gem allows to find edit distance between two UTF-8
or ASCII encoded strings with O(N\*M) efficiency.

This gem implements pure Levenshtein algorithm, Damerau modification of it
(where 2 character transposition counts as 1 edit distance). It also includes
Boehmer & Rees 2008 modification of Damerau algorithm, where transposition
of bigger than 1 character blocks is taken in account as well
(Boehmer & Rees 2008).

```ruby
require 'damerau-levenshtein'
DamerauLevenshtein.distance('Something', 'Smoething') #returns 1
```

Gem damerau-levenshtein is compatible with ruby versions 1.8.7
and 1.9.2 and higher, as well as 2.0.0 and higher

Installation
------------

    $ gem install damerau-levenshtein

Examples
--------

```ruby
require 'rubygems' #not needed for ruby >= 1.9.0
require 'damerau-levenshtein'
dl = DamerauLevenshtein
```

* compare using Damerau Levenshtein algorithm

```ruby
dl.distance("Something", "Smoething") #returns 1
```

* compare using Levensthein algorithm

```ruby
dl.distance("Something", "Smoething", 0) #returns 2
```

* compare using Boehmer & Rees modification

```ruby
dl.distance("Something", "meSothing", 2) #returns 2 instead of 4
```

* comparison of words with utf-8 characters should work fine:

```ruby
dl.distance("Sj√∂stedt", "Sjostedt") #returns 1
```

API Description
-----------

Gem defines two methods

```ruby
DamerauLevenshtein.version
#returns version number of the gem

DamerauLevenshtein.distance(string1, string2, block_size, max_distance)
#returns [edit distance][9] between 2 strings
```



DamerauLevenshtein.distance takes 4 arguments:

* string1
* string2
* block_size (default is 1)
* max_distance (default is 10)

`block_size` determines maximum number of characters in a transposition block:

    block_size = 0
    (transposition does not count -- it is a pure Levenshtein algorithm)

    block_size = 1
    (transposition between 2 adjustent characters --
    it is pure Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm)

    block_size = 2
    (transposition between blocks as big as 2 characters -- so abcd and cdab
    counts as edit distance 2, not 4)

    block_size = 3
    (transposition between blocks as big as 3 characters --
    so abcdef and defabc counts as edit distance 3, not 6)

    etc.

`max_distance` -- is a threshold after which algorithm gives up and
returns max_distance instead of real edit distance.

Levenshtein algorithm is expensive, so it makes sense to give up when edit
distance is becoming too big. The argument max_distance does just that.

    DamerauLevenshtein.distance('abcdefg', '1234567', 0, 3)
    # output: 4 -- it gave up when edit distance exceeded 3


Contributing to damerau-levenshtein
-----------------------------------

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been
implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested
it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want
to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please
isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
